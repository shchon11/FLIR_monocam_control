# ros2 bag record takes topic names, not globs. A pattern like
# /camera_*/image_rgb/compressed is a *shell* glob: it matches no files, so bash
# passes it through verbatim and the recorder waits for a topic literally named
# "/camera_*/..." that never appears — the bag comes out empty. --regex is how a
# set of topics gets selected.
#
# What each topic is for:
#   image_rgb/compressed  the calibration input. Both calibration nodes subscribe
#                         to this (config/calibration.yaml line 3,
#                         config/extrinsic_calibration.yaml line 20), so the raw
#                         Bayer topic is not needed — and publish_raw is off.
#   camera_info           intrinsics travelling with the frames.
#   image_raw/metadata    carries camera_timestamp_ns, the PTP device timestamp.
#                         header.stamp on the image topics is host *arrival* time
#                         and scatters 4-8 ms across the rig, while the cameras
#                         actually expose within ~7 us of each other. A static
#                         calibration target barely cares, but this is the only
#                         place the true exposure time survives and it costs a few
#                         hundred bytes per frame, so record it.
